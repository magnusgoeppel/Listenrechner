# List Calculator
The List Calculator is a C-programmed tool that organizes and evaluates mathematical expressions using a linked list. Unlike traditional calculators, where an entire mathematical expression is entered at once, the List Calculator requires users to input each calculation step individually. This provides a step-by-step and detailed representation of the calculation process.

# Key Features

## Linked List for Input Organization
Each input (number or operator) is stored as a node in a linked list.
This allows for flexible and dynamic storage of inputs, regardless of their length.

## Step-by-Step Input and Evaluation
After each input, the program displays the current mathematical term.
This gives the user a clear understanding of the current state of the calculation.

## Support for Basic Operations
The calculator can process the basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).

## Error Handling for Division by Zero
To avoid errors, a division by zero is automatically treated as a division by 1.
This ensures that the program does not crash and provides a consistent user experience.

## Detailed Representation of Calculation Steps
When "=" is entered, the calculation is completed.
The program then presents the result along with a detailed calculation path, allowing the user to follow each step of the process.

# Usage
Start the program. Enter numbers and operators one after another. After each input, the current expression is displayed. Enter "=" for the result.
